        Beginning in 2016, ISIC has sponsored annual challenges for the computer science
        community in association with leading computer vision conferences. Over the years, the
        challenges have grown in scale, complexity, and participation, using high-quality
        human-validated training and test sets of thousands of images and metadata.
        The earlier challenges were focused primarily on diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing
        dermoscopic photos of melanoma from other skin lesions. By 2018, the diagnostic performance
        of the leading algorithms was consistently outperforming clinicians in "reader studies".
        Challenges in 2019 and 2020 were designed to address out-of-distribution classes
        and assess the impact of clinical context, respectively.
        The challenge in 2024 shifted focus from dermoscopy to 3D total-body-photography and involved 3,400 participants.
        In addition to the annual Grand Challenges,
        ISIC hosts "live challenges" that allow researchers and students to benchmark the
        performance of their algorithms using ISIC images on an ongoing basis.

        contains
        the largest publicly available collection of quality controlled dermoscopic
        images of skin lesions.
      </p>
      <p>Presently, the ISIC Archive contains nearly 500,000 public
        images, which were collected from leading clinical centers
        internationally and acquired from a variety of devices within each center. Broad
        and international participation in image contribution is designed to insure a
        representative clinically relevant sample.
      </p>
      <p>All incoming images to the
        ISIC Archive are screened for both privacy and quality assurance. Most images
        have associated clinical metadata, which has been vetted by recognized melanoma
        experts. A subset of the images have undergone annotation and markup by
        recognized skin cancer experts. These markups include dermoscopic features
        (i.e., global and focal morphologic elements in the image known to discriminate
        between types of skin lesions).

      <h3>About Melanoma</h3>
      <p>Skin cancer is a major public health problem, with over
        5,000,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States every year. Melanoma is the
        deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for an overwhelming majority of skin
        cancer deaths. In 2015, the global incidence of melanoma was estimated to be
        over 350,000 cases, with almost 60,000 deaths. Although the mortality is
        significant, when detected early, melanoma survival exceeds 95%.

      <h3>About Dermoscopy</h3>
      <p>As pigmented lesions occurring on the surface of the
        skin, melanoma is amenable to early detection by expert visual inspection. It is
        also amenable to automated detection with image analysis. Given the widespread
        availability of high-resolution cameras, algorithms that can improve our ability
        to screen and detect troublesome lesions can be of great value. As a result,
        many centers have begun their own research efforts on automated analysis.
        However, a centralized, coordinated, and comparative effort across institutions
        has yet to be implemented.
      </p>
      <p>Dermoscopy is an imaging technique that
        eliminates the surface reflection of skin. By removing surface reflection,
        visualization of deeper levels of skin is enhanced. Prior research has shown
        that when used by expert dermatologists, dermoscopy provides improved diagnostic
        accuracy, in comparison to standard photography. As inexpensive consumer
        dermatoscope attachments for smart phones are beginning to reach the market, the
        opportunity for automated dermoscopic assessment algorithms to positively
        influence patient care increases.
